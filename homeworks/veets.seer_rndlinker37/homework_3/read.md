Mario problem

Implement a program for printing two half-pyramids made of special symbol (for example, #) of a defined height with two spaces between them. For example, for height 4 it should print this:

Height: 4
   #  # 
  ##  ## 
 ###  ### 
####  ####

The height should be defined as a variable in the program source code. By default it can be 4, but program has to work with any positive integer >=2 as a height.
The console output of the program should print the value of the height and these half-pyramids.
